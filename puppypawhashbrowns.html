    <h2>Puppy Paw Hash Browns from Genshin Impact</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Oil as needed</li>
      <li>3-4 yukon gold potatoes</li>
      <li>2 tbsp flour</li>
      <li>⅓ cup pine nuts, ground</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
      <li>½ tsp kosher salt</li>
      <li>½ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prepare a large high-sided skillet with about 3 inches of fry oil.
        Preheat the oil to 275 °F.
      </li>
      <li>Peel and cut the potato into 1-inch cubes.</li>
      <li>
        Transfer the potato cubes into the preheated oil and fry for 4-6
        minutes, just until the potatoes have cooked but not gained color.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using a slotted spoon, transfer the potatoes to a sheet tray lined with
        paper towels. Allow the potatoes to cool, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Working in batches, use a ricer to break down the potatoes.</li>
      <li>
        Combine the broken down potatoes with the flour, pinenuts, egg, garlic,
        salt and pepper. Mix by hand or with a plastic spatula until completely
        homogenous.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the potato mixture to a silicone puppy paw mold. Freeze the molds
        for at least 1 hour or until the puppy paws release from the molds
        cleanly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, preheat the same oil used for the first fry to 350 °F. Strain
        the oil first if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the unmolded puppy paws for 3-5 minutes or until deeply golden
        brown. Transfer the fried puppy paws to a sheet tray lined with paper
        towels.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the puppy paw hash browns immediately. Serve with broccoli, tomato
        jam, and garlic aioli.
      </li>
    </ol>
