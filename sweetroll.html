    <h2>Sweetrolls from Skyrim</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Dough</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
      <li>1 cup warm whole milk</li>
      <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
      <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>Kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Frosting</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>200 grams confectioner’s sugar</li>
      <li>45 grams low fat milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Into a large mixing bowl combine 3 tablespoons of melted butter, 1 cup
        of warm whole milk, 2 tablespoons of honey, 2 teaspoons of active dry
        yeast, and 1 large egg then whisk together with a pinch of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add together with 2 cups of all-purpose flour and mix together until a
        smooth batter is formed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Generously butter the tube cans and spoon the batter inside. Make sure
        to wipe up any sticky excess. Cover with plastic wrap and rest at room
        temperature for 30 minutes during which the batter should expand double.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the plastic wrap and place the cakes onto a rimmed baking sheet
        and place into a preheated 350°F oven for 15 minutes or until lightly
        brown and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
      </li>
      <li>
        After letting the cakes cool in the pan for about 5 minutes, remove the
        cakes from the tube cans and let them completely cool on a wire rack.
      </li>
      <li>
        In which time the frosting can be made by mixing together 200 grams of
        confectioner’s sugar with 45 grams of low-fat milk and whisking together
        until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        At which point, generously spoon the frosting on top of the cake and
        enjoy it.
      </li>
    </ol>
