    <h2>Sea Salt Ice Cream from Kingdom Hearts</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 ½ cup cream</li>
      <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
      <li>3 tbsp cornstarch</li>
      <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
      <li>Teal gel-based food coloring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix together 1 ½ cups each of high quality milk and cream.</li>
      <li>
        Combine 3 tbsp cornstarch in about 1 cup of milk and cream mixture until
        it is dissolved and no lumps remain.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the remaining milk and cream mixture close to a simmer on the
        stovetop.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, ¾ cup sugar is added directly to the milk and cream on the
        stovetop until it dissolves over medium-low heat until just simmering.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point add the cornstarch mixture until combined. Let that all
        cook for about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add one heaping tsp of sea salt to custard on stovetop as it finishes
        thickening.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain into a heat-proof bowl. Add some gel-based teal food coloring.
      </li>
      <li>Into an ice cream machine it goes for about 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        After that’s done, pour into a piping bag in order to cleanly fill
        popsicle molds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use stick alignment to assure sticks stand up straight, and in the
        freezer it goes for at least 6 hours up to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>Run under hot water to easily take out popsicles and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
